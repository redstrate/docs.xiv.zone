There have been several benchmarks publicly released, which are [modified client executables]({{< ref "executable/ffxiv" >}}) that play several cutscenes in sequence (usually made exclusively for the benchmark) and can create [character creation save data]({{< ref "chardat" >}}).

Despite the [official FFXIV Benchmark site](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark/) only displaying the latest expansion, previous benchmarks are still accessible. An archive of all links are provided below.

{{< info "ARR and Heavenward place the benchmark files under a `/inst` directory on their server. Expansions afterward, place it under a directory with a directory with a seemingly randomized string such as 'nr2xkhecw9vrkuqy'." >}}
