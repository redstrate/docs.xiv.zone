title: "Game Masters"
---

These are moderators in the game, and can be called upon when reporting a player. To carry out their tasks, they are given access to special commands not available to normal players. If a normal player attempts to use a command, nothing happens - the client won't even send it unless they have a GM rank.

# Ranks

There is not a single "rank" or "level" of GM, but in fact several. This probably mirrors the same structure seen in XI, where there are Junior GMs lead by one or more senior GMs. There are also event GMs?

# Commands

Since we don't have access to any documentation to what these commands do, the purpose and usage are guesswork.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `//gm invis` | Turns the current player invisible. |
